3. schedule the batch pipeline with Composer.

Products: _Cloud Shell_, _Cloud Source Repositories_, _Pub/Sub_, _Cloud Dataflow_, _BigQuery_, _Cloud Datastore_, _Cloud Storage_, _Cloud Composer_

Frameworks: _Apache Beam_, _Apache Airflow_

### Preparations

1. In Cloud Console, navigate to APIs & Services

2. Enable APIs for Pub/Sub, Cloud Dataflow, and Cloud Composer

or, alternatively,

2. Enable APIs from the Cloud Shell command line by
```
gcloud services enable pubsub.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable dataflow.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable composer.googleapis.com
```

3. From Cloud Shell Terminal settings go to Terminal preferences/Keyboard and click Alt is Meta. This is to ensure you can enter characters like [] in the terminal without complications.

### Pub/Sub

1. Open Cloud Shell (preferably in a new tab) and clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/qvik/gcp-data-training.git
```

If you want to use your local code editor instead of the Cloud Shell code editor, follow these steps (you will need to have installed Google Cloud SDK locally):

- Create a repository in Cloud Source Repositories
```
gcloud source repos create gcp-data-training
```

- In the repository folder, add remote
```
git remote add google https://source.developers.google.com/p/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/r/gcp-data-training
```

- Push
```
git push google master
```

- Clone the `gcp-data-training` repository to your laptop by following the instructions in Source Repositories

Back to Cloud Shell, everyone!

2. Create a virtual environment for the publisher by
```
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python pubvenv
```

3. Activate it and install the Python client for Pub/Sub
```
source pubvenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-pubsub numpy
```

4. Open `publisher.py` in your code editor and inspect the code

5. In Cloud Console, navigate to Pub/Sub, create a topic `stream_data_ingestion` and for it a subscription `process_stream_data`

or, alternatively,

5. Create the topic and its subscription from command line
```
gcloud pubsub topics create stream_data_ingestion
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create --topic stream_data_ingestion process_stream_data
```

6. Run `publisher.py`

7. Open a new Cloud Shell tab and pull messages from the subscription to make sure data is flowing
```
gcloud pubsub subscriptions pull --auto-ack \
projects/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/subscriptions/process_stream_data
```

8. Interrupt the Python process `publisher.py` with `CTRL-C`

### Streaming pipeline

1. Open a new Cloud Shell tab and create a virtual environment for the pipeline
```
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python beamvenv
```

2. Activate it and install the Apache Beam Python SDK
```
source beamvenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade apache-beam[gcp]
```

3. Open `stream_pipeline.py` in your code editor and inspect the different suggestions for pipelines

4. Take a look at the [Apache Beam Programming Guide](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/), the
[Python reference](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/2.8.0/), and the [examples in GitHub](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples)

5. Go to BigQuery console and create a dataset `my_dataset` and an empty table `stream_data` with fields `timestamp: TIMESTAMP, location: STRING, spend: INTEGER`

6. Launch `publisher.py` in another tab (in its virtual environment) and try out different pipelines with DirectRunner
```
python stream_pipeline.py --runner DirectRunner
```

7. Interrupt the Python processes with `CTRL-C`

8. Create a Cloud Storage bucket `<project_id>-dataflow` for Dataflow temp and staging either from the console or from the command line (see `gsutil help`)
```
gsutil mb -l europe-west1 gs://$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT-dataflow
```

9. Take a look at [Dataflow documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/service/dataflow-service-desc) and run the pipeline in Dataflow
```
python stream_pipeline.py --runner DataflowRunner
```

10. View the pipeline by navigating to Dataflow in Cloud Console

11. Clean up by stopping the pipeline and the publisher script

### Batch pipeline

1. In Cloud Console, navigate to Datastore and create a database

2. Inspect `batch_pipeline.py` in your code editor and fill in the missing code

3. Run the pipeline to make sure it works (activate `beamvenv` first)
```
python batch_pipeline.py --runner DirectRunner
```


### Cloud Composer

1. In Cloud Console, navigate to Cloud Composer

2. Create an environment named `data-transfer-environment` in `europe-west1` (this takes a while to finish)

3. Take a look at [Cloud Composer documentation](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/concepts/features)

4. Create a Cloud Storage bucket for data export
```
gsutil mb -l europe-west1 gs://$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT-data-export
```

5. Copy the pipeline into storage bucket
```
gsutil cp pipelines/batch_pipeline.py gs://$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT-dataflow/pipelines/
```

6. Take a look at [Apache Airflow API Reference](http://airflow.apache.org/code.html)

7. Open `scheduler.py` in your code editor and fill in the missing code

8. Once the environment is ready, navigate to the Airflow web UI and explore it

9. Set the Airflow variable
```
gcloud composer environments run data-transfer-environment \
    --location europe-west1 variables -- --set gcp_project $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
```

10. Submit your scheduling to Composer by copying `scheduler.py` into the `dags` folder of your Composer environment bucket

11. Run the pipeline manually, if necessary, and inspect the runs in the web UI

12. View the pipeline by navigating to Dataflow in Cloud Console

### Exercise

1. Draw an architecture diagram of the pipelines in Lab 2


### Clean up

1. In Cloud Console, delete the Composer environment and its storage bucket

2. Check that no Dataflow pipelines are running
